Datatypes
---------

Built into the SMT-LIB language is a mechanism for defining *(algebraic)
datatypes*.  Datatypes are highly useful in applications for reasoning
about data structures like records, lists, and trees [R7]_.  The
quantifier-free logic name is |QF_DT|.

  _`Example 10`.  Model a binary tree containing integer data.  Find trees
  :math:`x` and :math:`y` such that :math:`(i)` the left subtree of :math:`x`
  is the same as the right subtree of :math:`y` and :math:`(ii)` the data
  stored in :math:`x` is greater than :math:`100`.

Note that we need both datatypes and integer arithmetic for this example.
|cvcv| supports the logic name |QF_DTLIA|, but |ziii| does not.
Fortunately, we can always use |ALL| for the logic if a
more specific logic is not available.

.. api-examples::
   <examples>/datatypes.smt2
   <examples>/datatypes.py

The output from |cvcv| is:

.. api-examples::
   <examples>/datatypes.out.smt2
   <examples>/datatypes.out.py

..

  _`Exercise 8`.  Show that a tree cannot be equal to its own left subtree.
