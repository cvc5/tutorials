Satisfiability Modulo Theories: A Beginner's Tutorial
=================================================================================

Great minds have long dreamed of creating machines that can function as
general-purpose problem solvers. Satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) has
emerged as one pragmatic realization of this dream, providing significant
expressive power and automation. This tutorial is a beginnerâ€™s guide to SMT. It
includes an overview of SMT and its formal foundations, a catalog of the main
theories used in SMT solvers, and illustrations of how to obtain models and
proofs. Throughout the tutorial, examples and exercises are provided as
hands-on activities for the reader. They can be run using either Python or the
SMT-LIB language, using either the cvc5 or the z3 SMT solver.
